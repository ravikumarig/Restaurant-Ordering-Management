**Project Summary**

Restaurant Food Ordering Management System: The system is all about an online application for the dine-in customers of a fine dine Restaurant.This application will be accessible with a tablet fixed to each of the tables in the Restaurant. Via this application customers can view the food-menu eliminating hard-copies of paper/plastic based food-menu. Moreover, the customer can place orders without waiting for a waiter to come and take an order, such a process can also avoid the confusion of wrong order or any other conflicts pertaining to the order between the customer and waiter. The Customer can also perform various other operations like view order and track its progress in kitchen. Manager will process all the customer orders and billing tasks. There is a third role ADMIN who manages Customers, Managers, and Menu Items.

My Project uses the MVC framework, where I have used composite components for reusability. All business logic is managed by the Controller, backing bean as a model, JSF as a view and ejb's as service. HTML, basic CSS and bootstrap libraries along with PrimeFaces library is used. Approapriate validation and test cases are met. Sample data is provided with the help of insert.sql. CRUD functionalities are implemented according to the business domain.
